* Project Manage leaks *

Future project ideia  is to use Kibana and ElasticSearch to manage leaks. 
It's a great way to handle and  manage multiple types of information from people or organizations. 

# Setup

Elasticsearch
Kibana

# Step by Step

-Install resources
-File  .xls/xlsx with the raw data
-Use Excelastic tu upload data to elasticsearch
-Manage data in Kibana

setup

* cert in elasticserach *

openssl pkcs12 -in PKCS12file -out keys_out.txt
 
*After entering the above command you will receive these prompts:

Enter Import Password: (this is the password that was used when the PKCS12 file was created)

MAC verified OK

Enter PEM pass phrase: (this is the private key password)

Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: (confirm the private key password)
 
The private key, certificate, and any chain files (roots) will be parsed and dumped into the "keys_out.txt" file.


openssl pkcs12 -in elastic-certificates.p12 -cacerts -nokeys -out elastic-ca.pem
