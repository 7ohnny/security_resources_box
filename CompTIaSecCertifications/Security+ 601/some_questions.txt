-Which of the following is not a characteristic of effective signage?
Signage should indicate the location and route to emergency evacuation exits, not security checkpoints, in the event of an emergency requiring evacuation.

-Which of the following terms indicates the length of time a device =
The mean time to failure (MTTF) is the length of time a device is expected to last in operation. In MTTF, only a single, definitive failure will occur and will require that the device be replaced rather than repaired.
Mean time between failures (MTBF) represents the manufacturer's best guess (based on historical data) regarding how much time will pass between major failures of that component.

-Correct Answers
99.99 percent availability accounts for 52 minutes of downtime per year.
Incorrect Answers:
99.999 percent availability allows only 5.26 minutes of downtime per year, which may not be enough if the server requires almost an hour of maintenance time.
99.9 percent availability equates to more than 8 hours of downtime per year and exceeds the stated requirement.
99 percent availability is more than 3 days of downtime per year, far exceeding the requirement for no more than 1 hour of downtime.

Correct Answer:

A deterrent control keeps someone from performing a malicious act, provided that he or she knows the control is there and is aware of the consequences for violating it.

Incorrect Answers:

The difference between a deterrent control and a preventive control is that it is necessary for a potential attacker to have knowledge of the deterrent control for it to be effective. Users do not have to have knowledge of a preventative control for it to function.

A corrective control is used to correct a condition when there is either no control at all, or when the existing control is ineffective. Normally, a corrective control is temporary until a more permanent solution is put into place.

A compensating control assists and mitigates the risk when an existing control is unable to do so.

An access control entry (ACE) is a unique entry in an access control list (ACL) that describes a user's permissions for accessing objects.

Correct Answer:

In a walkthrough test, team members go through the motions of fulfilling the responsibilities and conducting the activities required during an actual incident or disaster.

Incorrect Answers:

A tabletop exercise is a type of group review.

The documentation review is the simplest form of test, in which the business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan, and associated documents are reviewed by relevant personnel including managers, recovery team members, and anyone else who may have responsibilities directly affecting plans.

In a full-scale test, all personnel are usually involved and may actually conduct activities as they would during a real incident. This type of test is more complex and normally requires extensive resources, such as people and equipment, so it is typically conducted infrequently.

Diffie-Hellman Exchange (DHE) is a key negotiation and agreement protocol used in public key cryptography.

Correct Answer:

A threat assessment looks at events that could exploit vulnerabilities.

Incorrect Answers:

A vulnerability assessment looks for weaknesses in systems.

The business impact analysis (BIA) is a critical first step in developing the business continuity plan (BCP). It involves determining what risks are present and their effects on the business and its assets.

Incorrect Answers:

The BCP is the overall and final product that the BIA contributes to. The BIA must be completed as one of the first steps, as it essentially is the risk assessment for the BCP.

The disaster recovery plan (DRP) concerns itself with recovering the assets and operations of the business immediately following a disaster.

A system backup plan is but one element of the DRP and may or may not be one of the first things accomplished for that plan.

IPSec provides encryption services for L2TP 1701(tcp) when used in a VPN implementation.

OBJ-4.2: Security assertions markup language (SAML) is an XML-based framework for exchanging security-related information such as user authentication, entitlement, and attributes. SAML is often used in conjunction with SOAP. SAML is a solution for providing single sign-on (SSO) and federated identity management. It allows a service provider (SP) to establish a trust relationship with an identity provider (IdP) so that the identity of a user (the principal) can be trusted by the SP without the user having to authenticate directly with the SP. The principal's User Agent (typically a browser) requests a resource from the *service provider (SP)*. The resource host can also be referred to as the relying party (RP). If the user agent does not already have a valid session, the SP redirects the user agent to the identity provider (IdP). The IdP requests the principal's credentials if not already signed in and, if correct, provides a SAML response containing one or more assertions. The SP verifies the signature(s) and (if accepted) establishes a session and provides access to the resource.

OBJ-5.5: When collecting evidence, you should always follow the order of volatility. This will allow you to collect the most volatile evidence (most likely to change) first, and the least volatile (least likely to change) last. You should always begin the collection with the CPU registers and cache memory (L1/L2/L3/GPU). The contents of system memory (RAM), including a routing table, ARP cache, process tables, kernel statistics, and temporary file systems/swap space/virtual memory. Next, you would move onto the collection of data storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and flash memory devices. After that, you would move onto less volatile data such as backup tapes, external media devices (hard drives, DVDs, etc.), and even configuration data or network diagrams.

password spraying that focuses on attempting only one or two passwords per user, a brute force attack focuses on trying multiple passwords for a single user.
DSA asymmetric 
AES, RC4, and DES are all symmetric algorithms.

OBJ-5.8: Tokenization means that all or part of data in a field is replaced with a randomly generated token. The token is stored with the original value on a token server or token vault, separate from the production database.

Via voip and others systems
OBJ-2.5: NIST’s SP 800-63-3 recommends that SMS messages be deprecated as a means of delivering a second factor for multifactor authentication because they may be accessible to attackers. SMS is unable to be encrypted (at least without adding additional applications to phones). A third factor is typically not a user-friendly recommendation and would be better handled by replacing SMS with the proposed third factor instead. SMS is not a costly method since it can be deployed for less than $20/month at scale.

OBJ-2.1: Endpoint(host) security includes software host-based firewalls, host-based intrusion protection systems (HIPS), and anti-virus software. 
A VPN is not typically considered an endpoint security tool because it is a network security tool.

OBJ-3.7: A managed security service provider (MSSP) provides security as a service (SECaaS). IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS (infrastructure, platform, and software as a service) do not include security monitoring as part of their core service offerings. Security as a service or a managed service provider (MSP) would be better suited for this role. 

OBJ-4.3: Iris scans rely on the matching of patterns on the surface of the eye using near-infrared imaging, and so is less intrusive than retinal scanning (the subject can continue to wear glasses, for instance), and much quicker. 

During which incident response phase is the preservation of evidence performed ->
OBJ-5.4: A cybersecurity analyst must preserve evidence during the containment, eradication, and recovery phase. They must preserve forensic and incident information for future needs, to prevent future attacks, or to bring up an attacker on criminal charges. Restoration and recovery are often prioritized over analysis by business operations personnel, but taking time to create a forensic image is crucial to preserve the evidence for further analysis and investigation. During the preparation phase, the incident response team conducts training, prepares their incident response kits, and researches threats and intelligence. During the detection and analysis phase, an organization focuses on monitoring and detecting any possible malicious events or attacks. During the post-incident activity phase, the organization conducts after-action reports, creates lessons learned, and conducts follow-up actions to better prevent another incident from occurring.

OBJ-6.1: The only truly unbreakable encryption is one that uses a one-time use pad. This ensures that every message is encrypted with a different shared key that only the two owners of the one-time use pad would know. This technique ensures that there is no pattern in the key for an attacker to guess or find. 

OBJ-2.1: Data loss prevention (DLP) software detects potential data breaches/data exfiltration transmissions and prevents them by monitoring, detecting, and blocking sensitive data while in-use, in-motion, and at-rest.

OBJ-4.3: Retinal scans utilize an infrared light that is shone into the eye to identify the pattern of blood vessels.

OBJ-3.2: Netflow is a flow analysis tool. Netflow does not capture the full packet capture of data as it crosses the network sensor but instead captures metadata and statistics about the network traffic. 

Hash is correct. To create a digital signature for a document, you hash the document using your private key. Others can verify your digital signature with your public key.

Kerberos uses UDP port 88 

OBJ-6.3: Captive portals usually rely on 802.1x, and 802.1x uses RADIUS for authentication.

OBJ-1.4: The beacon's protocol is not typically a means of identifying a malware beacon. A beacon can be sent over numerous protocols, including ICMP, DNS, HTTP, and numerous others. Unless you specifically knew the protocol being used by the suspected beacon, filtering out beacons by the protocol seen in the logs could lead you to eliminate malicious behavior prematurely. Other factors like the beacon's persistence (if it remains after a reboot of the system) and the beacon's interval (how much time elapses between beaconing)are much better indicators for fingerprinting a malicious beacon. The removal of known traffic by the script can also minimize the amount of data the cybersecurity analyst needs to analyze, therefore making it easier to detect the malicious beacon without wasting their time reviewing non-malicious traffic.

OBJ-4.3: HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) is an algorithm for token-based authentication. The authentication server and client token are configured with the same shared secret. The token could be a fob-type device or implemented as a smartphone app. The token does not have an expiration under HOTP, but an improved version known as TOTP does include token expirations.

OBJ-3.7: Desktop as a Service (DaaS) provides a full virtualized desktop environment from within a cloud-based service. This is also known as VDI (Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure) and is coming in large enterprise businesses that are focused on increasing their security and minimizing their operational expenses. Shadow PC (shadow.tech) provides a version of DaaS for home users who want to have a gaming PC without all the upfront costs.

OBJ-5.5: Both hardware and software write blockers are designed to ensure that forensic software and tools cannot change a drive inadvertently by accessing it. But, since the question indicates that you need to choose the BEST solution to protect the contents of the drive from being changed during analysis, you should pick the hardware write blocker. The primary purpose of a hardware write blocker is to intercept and prevent (or 'block') any modifying command operation from ever reaching the storage device. A forensic drive duplicator simply copies a drive and validates that it matches the original drive, but cannot be used by itself during analysis. A degausser is used to wipe magnetic media. Therefore, it should not be used on the drive since it would erase the contents of the hard drive.

What best describes how these various devices are placed into the network for the highest level of security?

OBJ-3.1: Defense in depth is the concept of layering various network appliances and configurations to create a more secure and defensible architecture. Dion Training appears to be using various host-based and network-based devices to help ensure there are multiple layers of security in the network.

OBJ-3.2: The organization should enable sampling of the data collected. Sampling can help them to capture network flows that could be useful without collecting everything passing through the sensor. This reduces the bottleneck of 2 Gbps and still provide useful information. Quality of Service (QoS) is a set of technologies that work on a network to guarantee its ability to run high-priority applications and traffic dependably, but that does not help in this situation. Compressing NetFlow data helps save disk space, but it does not increase the capacity of the bottleneck of 2 Gbps during collection. Enabling full packet capture would take even more resources to process and store, as well as not minimizing the bottleneck of 2 Gbps during collection.

BJ-2.1: Network Access Control (NAC) uses a set of protocols to define and implement a policy that describes how to secure access to network nodes whenever a device initially attempts to access the network. NAC can utilize an automatic remediation process by fixing non-compliant hosts before allowing network access. Network Access Control can control access to a network with policies, including pre-admission endpoint security policy checks and post-admission controls over where users and devices can go on a network and what they can do. In this scenario, implementing NAC can identify which machines are known and trusted Dion Training assets, and provide them with access to the secure internal network. NAC could also determine which are unknown machines (assumed to be those of CompTIA employees), and provide them with direct internet access only by placing them onto a guest network or VLAN. While MAC filtering could be used to allow or deny access to the network, it cannot by itself control which set of network resources could be utilized from a single ethernet port. A security information and event management (SIEM) system provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. An access control list could define what ports, protocols, or IP addresses the ethernet port could be utilized, but it would be unable to distinguish between a Dion Training employee's laptop and a CompTIA employee's laptop like a NAC implementation could.

OBJ-5.5: Due to the deletion of the VM disk image, you will now have to conduct file carving or other data recovery techniques to recover and remediate the virtualized server.

A cognitive password is a form of knowledge-based authentication that requires a user to answer a question, presumably something they intrinsically know, to verify their identity. If you post a lot of personal information about yourself online, then this type of password can easily be bypassed. For example, during the 2008 elections, Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin's email account was hacked because a high schooler used the "reset my password" feature on the Yahoo's email service to reset her password using the information that was publically available about Sarah Palin (like her birthday, high school, and other such information).

Banner grabbing is conducted by actively connecting to the server using telnet or netcat and collecting the response from the web server. This banner usually contains the operating system being run by the server as well as the version number of the service (SSH) being run. This is the fastest and easiest way to determine the version of SSH being run on this web server. While it is possible to use a vulnerability scanner, protocol analyzer, or to conduct a passive scan to determine the version of SSH, these are more time consuming and not fully accurate methods to determine the version being run.

Application whitelisting will only allow a program to execute if it is specifically listed in the approved exception list. All other programs are blocked from running. This makes it the BEST mitigation again a 11zero-day11 virus

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol, operating on port 1812 that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service. The RADIUS protocol utilizes an obfuscated password that is created from the shared secret and creates a MD5 hash of the authentication request to protect the communications.. 

OBJ-4.2: Shibboleth is a standards-based, open-source software package for single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries on the web. It allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner. Shibboleth utilizes SAML to provide this federated single sign-on and attribute exchange framework.
